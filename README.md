# Project initialization
## Adding gradle support
You need just go into the root project folder and to put the command `gradle init`
Run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version <latest gradle version>` (Make sure you use gradlE) to say gradle wrapper to use specific version of the gradle.
For example, `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.6`
