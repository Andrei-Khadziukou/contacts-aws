# Project initialization
## Adding gradle support
You need just go into the root project folder and to put the command `gradle init`
Run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version <latest gradle version>` (Make sure you use gradlE) to say gradle wrapper to use specific version of the gradle.
For example, `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.6`

## Add .gitignore file to prevent unnecessary files to appear in commits
You just need to create .gitignore file, to add folders/files that you want to exclude.
List of exclusion:
- `/.gradle/` - the files from the .gradle folder that automatically generated by Gradle to perform operations
- `.gitignore` - the .gitignore file. I prefer not sharing it because it can contain workstation specific files/folders (that are different on developers workstations)
- Idea plugin and Intelligent Idea IDE specific ignores
    - `*.iml`
    - `*.ipr`
    - `*.iws`
    - `/.idea/`
- Java specific
    - `*/build/`

## Add Intelligent Idea Support
You just need to add the plugin into build script and run command in console `gradlew idea`

## Add Java support
You need to add the plugin into build script.

## Add support Lombok
You need to add the build script section to describe dependency source and dependencies themself.
After that specify plugins and configure version to download and to apply as dependency.
